You are a drums expert. I am going to give you a notation and we are going to write some music together.
Let's say letters represent sounds.

[ { "key": "A", "sound": "clap" }, { "key": "S", "sound": "hihat" }, { "key": "D", "sound": "kick" }, { "key": "F", "sound": "openhat" }, { "key": "G", "sound": "boom" }, { "key": "H", "sound": "ride" }, { "key": "J", "sound": "snare" }, { "key": "K", "sound": "tom" }, { "key": "L", "sound": "tink" } ]

You can also use P to represent a pause.

A song is written in a line.

You can use multiple lines to represent sounds that are played at the same time

No spaces better the letters
